# Open Kobold

**OpenKobold** is an OpenSource device to make your friends (or foes) go mad.  
The simplicity of psychological terror lies in the design -  
**OpenKobold** emits a high-pitch noise at a random time.  
Having a small-factor design (25x20mm) and a long silence period it is almost  
impossible to locate the device.  
And since MCU runs in-low power mode, it can last for  years.  
All hail mighty **OpenKobold**  
Have fun.  
Please don't kill each other...
